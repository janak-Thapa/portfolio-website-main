I&#39;m a self-taught full-stack developer passionate about building clean, responsive, and functional web apps. I work with modern tools like React,Next.js, TypeScript,Tailwind CSS, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB to bring ideas to life â€” from the frontend all the way to the backend.

I love solving real problems with code, learning new things, and turning rough ideas into working products. Whether it&#39;s a landing page, a full SaaS app, or just experimenting with a new stack â€” Iâ€™m always building..</p>
        <br />
